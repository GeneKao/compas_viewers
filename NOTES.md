# because of current near/far settings of the camera
# the viewer has difficulties displaying very small or very large objects
# near/far should be set based on the size of the objects
# user should be able to change these settings

# camera aiming should be implemented with gluLookAt
# zooming, rotating, panning should be implemented accordingly

# there seems to be an issue with keeping the mesh and meshview synchronised

# some lighting would be appropriate
# texture mapping for appreciation of mesh quality?

# don't auto-center the objects
# provide zoom extents and focus functions instead
# allow user to adjust camera settings
# and adapt projection parameters to the size of the model
